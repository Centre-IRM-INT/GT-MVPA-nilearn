# GT-MVPA-nilearn
Repository to centralize the discussions and the sharing of expertise within the MVPA Working Group (GT MVPA) coordinated by the [Centre IRM INT](https://irmf.int.univ-amu.fr/) in Marseille, France. It is mostly centered around the use of the [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/) python module. 

Please use the issues section as a question/answer forum!

Also, for the initial upload of your code, you can use very simple practice (forget about good github practices for now!!!!):
- no need to fork the repo and attempt to open a pull request (PR), you are allowed to directly commit to the present repository
- go to the "Code" tab, then do "Add file" and "Upload files" (there, you can upload a directory with your file inside it so that you will add a directory at the root of the repository)
- you can then simply "Commit directly to the main branch"
