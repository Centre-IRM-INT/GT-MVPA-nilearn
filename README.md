Please use the issues section as a question/answer forum!

Also, for the initial upload of your code, you can use very simple practice (forget about good github practices for now!!!!):
- no need to fork the repo and attempt to open a pull request (PR), you are allowed to directly commit to the present repository
- go to the "Code" tab, then do "Add file" and "Upload files" (there, you can upload a directory with your file inside it so that you will add a directory at the root of the repository)
- you can then simply "Commit directly to the main branch"
-
